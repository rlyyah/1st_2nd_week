1.nano, cat, head, tail, more and less

nano - open text file in editor - lets you input, delete, find or even justify the text. 
You can save all or even ask for help

cat - shows you insides of the file in terminal

head - gives you x first lines of document in terminal

tail - gives you x last lines of document in terminal

more - is a command to view (but not modify) the contents of a text file one screen at a time

less - is a terminal pager program systems used to view (but not change) the contents of a text file one screen at a time.

With code -d <file> <file>, you can open 2 test files at the same time and compare them,
There is also -a to add an folder to last active window, 
-g <file:line[:character]> to open a file at a specified line and character position
-n Force to open new window,
-r to force a file or a folder in a already opened window
-w to wait for file or folder to be closed before returning 
-h to help and check the others arguments

To open google chrome via TERMINAL just type "google-chrome"

2.copying and removing

cp -i ./linuxCC.txt ./CopyHere/
rm ./linuxCC.txt

moving takes more time than copying bc moving also removes file from current location

3. wget -o

wget command downloads files served with HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP over a network.
can work in the background, while the user is not logged on, 
which allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system

wget -o (--output-file=logfile) Log all messages to logfile. 
The messages are normally reported to standard error

wget -O (-O file, --output-document=file) 
The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, 
but all will be concatenated together and written to file.
If "-" is used as file, documents will be printed to standard output, 
disabling link conversion. (Use "./-" to print to a file literally named "-".)
